methods used:
originally i tried to make the 5 day forecast in css but realized i would have to make each display (temp, uv, wind) for each day unique, which wouldve been too many variables to keep track of. instead i opted to make them dynamically in javascript with a foreach loop which was less code but somehow more work (probably cause im not too bueno at js quite yet.)I tried adding a search history but after a few failed attempts, deleted it which was just as cathartic as getting it working.  the html is basic, with only enough barebones stuff to get a layout going and to be able to hook into the sections i need in javascript since it was mostly made through js, and the css is just for the aesthetics (which there are few of.) the background was a simple for loop that i tried doing a switch case for, but i can read if statements much more easily so i opted for one of those. somehow this exercise made me more confident in my abilities but less confident in my skills. soon i wont sweat the small stuff but until then, i continue to curse my laptop everytime it doesn't all work perfectly on the first try.
